# Third Year Machine Learning Module 

Assignment 1
(pol_regression2.0.py)

This assignment's task was to solve a polynomial regression example. 
The regression algorithm was implemented using numpy matrix operations only. The pol_regression function takes as arguments the training input and output values as
input (both are 1D numpy array with number of data-points elements). The last argument in the function defines the degree of the polynomial that we want to fit.

Assignment 2
(Section1.py & Section3and4.py)

The objectives of this assignment were to critique and appraise the scope and limits of machine learning methods
by identifying their strengths and weaknesses. In addition to this, using a non-trivial dataset, plan, execute and evaluate significant
experimental investigations using multiple machine learning strategies.

This assignment was split into three sections (Section 2 was a report on discussing machine learning algorithms).

Section 1: Data import, summary, pre-processing and visualisation

Section 3: Designing algorithms 

Section 4: Model selection
