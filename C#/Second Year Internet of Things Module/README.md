# Second Year Internet of Things Module

This module had us working with Arduino microcontrollers. This work is from the workshops leading up to the assignment. 
However due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to continue this work as the microcontrollers could not be accessed as the university campus shut down.
Instead, a report on the Internet of Things was assigned.
